            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve.
                A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.
                These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.
                Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local
                 and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and
                 the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide
                  free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".

                The education system in Pakistan is generally divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (years one to five), middle (years six to eight), high (years nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), 
                intermediate (years eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.The Higher Education Commission established in 2002 is responsible for all universities
                 and degree awarding institutes.It was established in 2002 with Atta-ur-Rahman as its Founding Chairman.

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Education is not how well you can read and write but whether you can communicate with and understand the world around you. A good education not only teaches you skills but also helps you broaden your horizons, gain better perspective,
                 and teaches you to think for yourself. People today are quite aware and comfortable speaking about social injustices and other pressing issues. This can be attributed to the increased access to education around the world, which in turn has made society more accepting
                  and open-minded. Therefore, education is an element of human evolution. The importance of education is also pronounced in areas of creativity and innovation. Education encourages thinking outside the box and experimenting with new ideas.
